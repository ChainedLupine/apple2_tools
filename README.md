# apple2_tools

My toolchain for building assembly for Apple II development.

Library requires Apple //e Enhanced.

Note: I'm using Windows, but this should be modified without too much trouble for other OSes.

To use, download and install:

1. [AppleCommander](https://github.com/AppleCommander) in tools/ac/
2. [cc65](https://github.com/cc65/cc65) in tools/cc65-snapshot-win32/
3. [tohgr](http://wsxyz.net/tohgr.html) in tools/tohgr/

Requires: python3

Extras: 
1. AppleWin for emulation
2. ADTPro to transfer disks to real Apple 2e
